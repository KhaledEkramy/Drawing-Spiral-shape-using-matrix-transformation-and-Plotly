# Dynamic Visualization of Transformed Points Using Plotly

## Overview

This documentation explains the theory behind the process of dynamically visualizing points transformed by a matrix using Plotly in Python. The objective is to update a plot in real-time by applying a transformation matrix to a set of points and visualizing these points on a curve (e.g., a spiral or helix) with a delay between updates.

## Key Concepts

1. **Transformation Matrix**:
   - A transformation matrix is a mathematical tool used to perform linear transformations on vectors in a coordinate system. 
   - In this context, the matrix is used to transform the coordinates of a point in a 2D space. Each iteration applies this matrix to update the position of the point.

2. **Vector Transformation**:
   - The transformation matrix `[[0.9, 0.8], [-1, 0.35]]` is used to transform the `prev_point` vector. 
   - Matrix multiplication is performed using `np.dot(transform_matrix, prev_point)` to calculate the new position `the_point`.
   - This transformation typically rotates and scales the point in a 2D space according to the matrix values.

3. **Dynamic Plotting**:
   - The goal is to visualize how points evolve under transformation over time. 
   - To achieve dynamic plotting, the figure is updated iteratively, and the plot is refreshed at each step.

4. **Plotly for Visualization**:
   - Plotly is a powerful library for creating interactive plots. It allows for rich and dynamic visualizations.
   - The `go.Figure` object is used to create a new plot, and traces are added to this figure to represent data points and lines.

5. **Updating the Plot**:
   - The plot is updated by modifying the existing data and layout of the figure.
   - `fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(...))` adds a trace to the figure which includes data points and lines.
   - `fig.update_layout(...)` adjusts the layout of the plot, including titles and axis labels.

6. **Real-time Updates**:
   - To create the effect of animation or real-time updates, the plot is cleared and redrawn in a loop.
   - `clear_output(wait=True)` clears the previous plot output in environments like Jupyter Notebooks.
   - `fig.show()` displays the updated plot.
   - `time.sleep(0.5)` introduces a delay between updates, allowing the plot to be refreshed at specified intervals.

## Process Breakdown

1. **Initialize Points and Matrix**:
   - Define the initial point coordinates and the transformation matrix.

2. **Transform Points**:
   - Use a loop to repeatedly apply the transformation matrix to update the point coordinates.
   - Store the updated coordinates in lists for plotting.

3. **Create and Update the Plot**:
   - Within each iteration of the loop:
     - Create a new figure.
     - Add updated data points and lines to the plot.
     - Update the plot layout to reflect the latest data.
     - Clear the previous plot and display the updated figure.
     - Introduce a delay to simulate real-time updating.
